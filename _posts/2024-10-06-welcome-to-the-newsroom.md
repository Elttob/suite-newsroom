title: Welcome to the Newsroom
---

Studio Elttob has been on a long journey to reach creators across all platforms,
whether it's the DevForum, Twitter, YouTube, or even further afield. It's been
a tough job to find both the professionals and the hobbyists that we build for.

Social media platforms get in the way of this actively. Oftentimes, these 
platforms are our vital archives of information that we don't control, and they
can be damaging echo chambers that drive away parts of our audience. That isn't
healthy, and it's time to pursue something better for everyone.

**This newsroom is the first step towards directly connecting with you instead.**
The goal of owning our own newsroom is to have one touchpoint for connecting
with the whole community, and discarding the injected noise that so often 
accompanies our posts.

From here on out, you'll receive most updates from here. While we'll continue to
tailor content for our Twitter and YouTube channels, this newsroom will be the
gravity that pulls all of our social media channels together.

If things seem rough around the edges, it's because they are. While there's been
some effort to keep everything visually pleasing and readable, this is still at
an experimental stage, so there hasn't been a large commitment yet to produce
something dedicated and perfectly-fit to the kinds of content that'll be posted
here. It'd be nice to invest more over time to make this place professional.
