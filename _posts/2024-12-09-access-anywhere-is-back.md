title: Access Anywhere is back
---

Hello everyone! It's been a while, but I'm happy to announce that Access Anywhere is back, and you can now request
Elttob Reclass in addition to Elttob Relight.

[You can find the Access Anywhere form here.](https://access-anywhere.elttob.studio)

Other small changes:

- Access Anywhere is now using a proper mail service, so emails will be coming from the `@elttob.studio` domain.
- There's more explicit data protection / anti-spam stipulations now. We guarantee that requests older than a month are
deleted - things already worked this way, but now it's explicit and in writing.
- You now explicitly consent to being contacted with your product key details. Again, things already worked this way,
but now it's in writing too.
- Emails are formatted with nicer HTML, and an explicit opt-out is included by default for completeness.
- You no longer have to specify a month in the form. This was causing confusion, so it's been removed.

I'm still working on getting Last Minute up and running for Reclass classic. Sorry for the delays there, there's no good
excuse for it.

Other than that, let me know if anything goes wrong and I'll be happy to help.
